## What The App Does
This app will get your general location and will perform an action upon clicking one of four buttons. "Get My Location Info" will bring up a map of your general area along with a list of restaurants and gas stations. "Get Local Gas Stations" will pull up a map of your general area and a list of gas stations in that area. "Get Local Restaurants" will pull up a map of your general area and a list of restaurants will be brought up up.  Using the search field you can search for restaurants in your local area.

### Future Update Ideas
* Upon opening the page bring up everything in a list. 
* Get better location accuracy 
* Organize the page for better readability on smaller screens.
